📄 BattleDisplay Class Documentation

Overview

The BattleDisplay class is a utility component responsible for handling all console-based visual outputs during battles in Cock Clashers: Object-Oriented Coliseum.
It enhances player experience by providing clear and structured text displays such as headers, health bars, and rooster selection menus.

This class does not manage any game logic; instead, it focuses solely on presentation, making it a key part of the game’s View Layer in the MVC-inspired structure.


---

Purpose

The purpose of the BattleDisplay class is to:

Visually represent game data in a readable format.

Provide players with an intuitive display during rooster selection and battle sequences.

Increase immersion through styled ASCII elements such as frames and graphical health bars.


It helps maintain clean separation between game logic (Model/Controller) and user interface (View).

Key Responsibilities

✔ Display Battle Header

Creates a stylized ASCII-art header to indicate the start of a battle sequence.

✔ Display Rooster Selection Menu

Lists available roosters with their corresponding:

Type

HP

Attack

Defense


This menu helps players make informed choices before entering combat.

✔ Display Health Bars

Generates a visual health bar for each rooster using ASCII characters:

█ represents remaining health

░ represents lost health


The bar dynamically scales based on the rooster’s current HP, providing real-time visual feedback during battle turns.

Methods and Descriptions

### displayHealthBar(Rooster rooster, int maxHp)

Description:
Displays a 20-character health bar representing the rooster’s current HP relative to its maximum HP.

How It Works:

Calculates the proportion of health remaining.

Fills the bar with █ for remaining HP, and ░ for missing HP.

Prints both graphical bar and numeric values (current HP / max HP).


Usage Example:

BattleDisplay.displayHealthBar(playerRooster, playerRooster.getMaxHp());

displayBattleHeader()

Description:
Prints a framed ASCII header titled “ROOSTER BATTLE ARENA” to mark the start of combat.

Sample Output:

2. Manok na Itim (High Attack) - Type: Dark
   HP: 100 | ATK: 40 | DEF: 8
3. Manok na Bato (High Defense) - Type: Rock
   HP: 150 | ATK: 20 | DEF: 20

Purpose:
Supports the setup phase of the battle by giving players clear information for decision-making.

Role in the System Architecture

The BattleDisplay class supports the View Layer, making the game interface more intuitive and readable.
It interacts with:

Models (Rooster objects) for retrieving health and names

Controllers that trigger display updates during combat


It does not modify data or handle battle logic, ensuring proper separation of concerns.

Future Enhancement Ideas

GUI-based display when migrating to JavaFX

Animated health bar transitions

Color-coded text for damage, healing, and special effects

Selectable interface themes
