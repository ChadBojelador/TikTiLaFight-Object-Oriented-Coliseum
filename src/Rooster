Description:

The Rooster class is an abstract class representing the combat units in the Cock Clashers game. Each rooster has attributes such as health points (HP), attack, defense, type, and skills.

It also handles sprite management for both front and back images, enabling visual representation during battles. Specific rooster types are implemented as subclasses with unique attributes and skills.

Key Features:

Stores and manages rooster stats (HP, attack, defense, type).

Manages skills and supports adding multiple skills per rooster.
